If you want a super-duper-lightweight template solution to go along with Zepto.js (works with jQuery too). This may be just what you're looking for.

If you're wanting full mustache.js you probably want ICanHaz.js (http://icanhazjs.com).

What is it?
IHazFlat is a client-side templating helper for working with Flatstache.js templates in the browser.

What is Flatstache?
A super-lightweight version of Mustache that removes support for partials and conditionals in the name of simplicity and tiny filesize. Flatstache was written by code wizard @natevw and is also on github at https://github.com/natevw/flatstache.js.

IHazFlat.js is MIT Licensed and includes @natevw's awesometastic flatstache.js for convenience. Also, high five to Chris Wanstrath for inventing Mustache (and founding github.com).
